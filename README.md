# duetmind_adaptive

**duetmind_adaptive** is a hybrid AI framework that combines Adaptive Neural Networks (AdaptiveNN) with DuetMind cognitive agents. AdaptiveNN provides the "brain"—dynamic, learning, biologically inspired neural networks—while DuetMind agents drive reasoning, memory, and social interaction.

## File Organization

All training and test files are organized in the following structure:

- **Training Files**: All training scripts are located in `files/files/training/`
- **Test Files**: All test scripts are located in `files/tests/`
- **Dataset Files**: Dataset utilities are located in `files/dataset/`
- **Neural Network Core**: The foundational neural network logic is implemented in `neuralnet.py`

This organization ensures a clean separation of concerns and makes it easy to locate specific functionality.

## Project Description

This project aims to develop living AI agents that possess:
- **Energy and Sleep Cycles:** Each agent simulates biological states such as energy and sleep, affecting its reasoning and performance.
- **Emergent Reasoning:** Agents' thought processes adapt dynamically based on internal neural network states.
- **Multi-Agent Dialogues:** Agents interact with each other, engaging in conversations and joint reasoning tasks.
- **Safety Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of "biological" neural processes to ensure safe operation.
- **Memory Consolidation:** Agents consolidate memory during sleep phases, influencing future reasoning and behavior.

Unlike conventional AI, duetmind_adaptive creates cognitive agents whose reasoning engines are living, adaptive neural networks—resulting in “living, breathing, sleeping” brains.

## System Architecture

The architecture is composed of two major components:

1. **AdaptiveNN ("Brain")**
    - Dynamic neural nodes with energy, sleep, and mood states
    - Learning and adaptation over time
    - Biological process monitoring
    - **Core implementation in [`neuralnet.py`](./neuralnet.py)**

2. **DuetMind ("Mind")**
    - Reasoning engine and dialogue management
    - Safety and social interaction modules
    - Memory consolidation and retrieval

python3 full_training.py --mode comprehensive

# Run simulation  
python3 run_simulation.py
```

Use the main entry point for more options:

```bash
# Interactive mode (default)
python3 main.py

# Run comprehensive training only
python3 main.py --mode training

# Run simulation only
python3 main.py --mode simulation

# Run both training and simulation

  - Adaptive behavior training
  - Multi-agent coordination training
  - Biological cycle integration training
- **Comprehensive Training Test**: Full system validation and reporting with:
  - Module import validation

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install kagglehub pandas psutil redis flask numpy
```

No additional setup required - the system uses synthetic training data and works out of the box.

### Legacy Training Scripts

The original training scripts are still available:

```bash
# Basic training script (requires kagglehub setup)
python3 files/files/training/run_training.py

# Modern API version (requires kagglehub setup)
python3 files/files/training/run_training_modern.py
```

These require Kaggle API setup but only load datasets without actual training.

## neuralnet.py: Neural Network Core

[`neuralnet.py`](./neuralnet.py) implements the foundational neural network logic powering agent cognition and adaptation.  
It includes:
- Biological state simulation (energy, sleep, mood)
- Memory and social signal processing
- Resource management and neural node dynamics

**Usage:**  
Most system scripts import and use `neuralnet.py` as the core adaptive neural network engine, but you can also run or extend it directly for custom neural network experiments.
